## 🚩 Problem Statement

Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) play a crucial role in the banking system, yet designing a reliable and user-friendly ATM interface is a common challenge in banking software development.

Common issues include:

- Limited simulation environments for ATM logic for learning or testing.
- Lack of GUI-based console interfaces for educational or demonstration purposes.
- Inability to simulate user authentication, transaction logging, and GUI interaction effectively.

**This project aims to create a GUI-based ATM simulation system using JavaFX**, providing a safe environment to understand ATM workflows without dealing with real hardware or backend banking systems.
